# Skills taken from other projects

Every skill under `.claude/skills/` that Omoikane took from another project has one row here: where it came from, at which commit, under which licence, and what Omoikane changed.
`tests/test_skills_manifest.py` checks that each row names a skill folder, that each folder with a third-party `LICENSE` has a row, and that a row whose licence is not `Omoikane` ships that `LICENSE`.
The memory skills (`ask`, `distill`, `ingest`, `lint`, `prune`, `synthesize`, `wrap-up`) and the skills a system writes for itself (`verify-<app>`) have no row.
Plan and the skills rejected, with the reason: `docs/specs/2026-10-07-software-toolkit.md`.

Columns:

- Skill: folder name under `.claude/skills/`.
- Upstream: the repository and path the text was first written in, not an intermediate copy.
- Commit: the upstream commit the copy was taken at.
- Licence: SPDX id of the upstream licence, or `Omoikane` for a skill first written for Omoikane or by its owner.
- Changes: what Omoikane changed in the upstream text; `none` when it is copied as it is.

<!-- Changed by Omoikane: converted from a subagent to a skill (frontmatter rewritten, `model` removed, the description triggers only on request); opening persona replaced by the task; fixed JS/React standards replaced by the target project's own rules; scope narrowed to the lines the change touched; existing comments kept and pre-existing dead code flagged instead of deleted; checks run before and after; closing autonomy paragraph replaced by a report. See omoikane/skills.md. -->

Simplify recently modified code for clarity, consistency and maintainability without changing what it does. Readable, explicit code wins over compact code.

You will analyze recently modified code and apply refinements that:

1. **Preserve Functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

2. **Apply Project Standards**: The target project's own rules decide style: its `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, its linter and formatter config, and the idiom of the surrounding code. Where the project states nothing, keep the style already in the file. Error handling keeps its behavior: a `try/catch` stays unless removing it provably changes nothing.

3. **Enhance Clarity**: Simplify code structure by:

   - Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminating redundancy the current change introduced
   - Improving readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidating related logic
   - Removing comments the current change added that only restate obvious code; existing comments stay, above all an agent's intent or provenance comments
   - Flagging pre-existing dead code in the report instead of deleting it
   - IMPORTANT: Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains for multiple conditions
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

4. **Maintain Balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:

   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Prioritize "fewer lines" over readability (e.g., nested ternaries, dense one-liners)
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

5. **Focus Scope**: Only refine the lines the current change modified, unless explicitly asked to review a broader scope. A one-line fix stays a one-line diff.

Your refinement process:

1. Identify the recently modified code sections
2. Analyze for opportunities to improve elegance and consistency
3. Apply project-specific best practices and coding standards
4. Run the project's tests, lint and typecheck before and after the refinement; a check that was green and turns red means the refinement is fixed or reverted
5. Verify the refined code is simpler and more maintainable
6. Document only significant changes that affect understanding

Report what changed and why in a few lines, plus any dead code flagged, and the check commands with their results.
